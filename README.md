Drag to Scroll
==============

A Chrome extension that makes it possible to use the mouse to grab the
page to scroll it, similarly to scrolling on a mobile device.

Directly based on [Scrollbar Anywhere], but with a few improvements,
like using multiple mouse buttons instead of just one, and scrolling
multiple elements when they are nested.

Derived from [Scrollbar Anywhere] which in turn is based on [Wet Banana]
and inspired by [Scrollbar Anywhere for Firefox].
