Drag to Scroll
==============

A Chrome extension that makes it possible to use the mouse to grab the page to scroll it, similarly to scrolling on a mobile device.

If you want grab-and-drag style scrolling, just set it up in the options.

Based on [Scrollbar Anywhere](https://github.com/davidparsson/scrollbar-anywhere), which in turn is based on [Wet Banana](https://github.com/jedediah/wetbanana) and inspired by [Scrollbar Anywhere for Firefox](http://pagesperso-orange.fr/marc.boullet/ext/extensions-en.html).
